<h1>Lots-O-Objects Benchmark</h1>
<p>This sample attempts to draw as many objects as possible at 60 frames.</p>
<p>Before running this test you should turn off as many other programs as you can</p>
<p>If you are comparing browsers</p>
<ul>
<li>try to make sure the content area is about the same size in all browsers</li>
<li>only run the test in 1 browser at a time</li>
<li>make sure all browsers are completely on the same monitior if you have more than 1 monitor</li>
<li>make sure each browser is complete visible and not overlapped by menus, docks, task bars, notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>This sample uses the standard drawElements function call, once for each object.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of objects. A sphere, a cube and a cone. They are drawn in batches of 50
to simulate a semi-optimized game. In other words, WebGL is setup to draw a sphere (setting
the program, the attributes, and common uniforms), then 50 spheres are drawn one at a time
(setting the uniforms that are unique for the sphere, then calling gl.drawElements). Followed
by the next group of 50 and so on.</p>
