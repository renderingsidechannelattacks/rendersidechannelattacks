# rendersidechannelattacks  
We study a new type of side channel in which a cross-origin adversary targets incremental rendering and measures the rendering performance between consecutive frames over time.  
This is the prototype, open-source framework, called SideR, and successfully launched three types of attacks, namely history sniffing, runtime website fingerprinting and keystroke logging, based on the framework.  
## environment  
We deploy this project on Apachw2 + Flask. We also show the [demo]  (http://renderingsidechannelattacks.com:8080/).
