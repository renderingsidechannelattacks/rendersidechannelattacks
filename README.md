# rendersidechannelattacks  
We study a new type of side channel in which a cross-origin adversary targets incremental rendering and measures the rendering performance between consecutive frames over time.  
This is the prototype, open-source framework, called SideR, and successfully launched three types of attacks, namely history sniffing, runtime website fingerprinting and keystroke logging, based on the framework.
